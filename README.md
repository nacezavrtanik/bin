This repository contains custom bash commands for my **TUXEDO Aura 15 Gen2** system, running **Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS**.

## Setup
1. Clone repository into `~/`
~~~
cd                          # go to home dir
git clone <repo>            # clone repo
~~~

2. In `~/.bashrc`, add repository to `PATH`
~~~
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin     # add repo to path
~~~

3. Place other required files into appropriate directories
   - text files
   - wallpapers
   - others (?)
